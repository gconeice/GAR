Augment ROOM w/ generation lookup table
  Namely, each index is associated w/ a set of keys
  The particular key should depend on the RAM timer
  The association between RAM timer and which key is looked up is secret

  Perhaps start by first just adding a simple lookup table at each index



Slow loading stack
  Each stack is accessed randomly.
  Thus, the probability that a particular stack will exhaust O(sqrt(N))
  elements faster than its sibling is negligible.
  Design a "queue" with nondeterministic pop, but deterministic push.
  By initializing the queue with O(sqrt(n)) elements and O(sqrt(n)) vacancies,
  then deterministically filling at rate 1/2, we can be sure we will never exhaust a stack.
